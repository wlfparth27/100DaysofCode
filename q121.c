//Q121: Write a C program that creates a text file named info.txt in write mode. The program should take the user’s name and age as input, and write them to the file using fprintf(). After writing, display a message confirming that the data was successfully saved.

/*
Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
Name: Rahul, Age: 23
Output 1:
File created successfully! Data written to info.txt

*/
#include <stdio.h>
int main() 
{
    FILE *file;
    char name[100];
    int age;

    // Open the file in write mode
    file = fopen("info.txt", "w");
    if (file == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening file!\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Take user input for name and age
    printf("Enter your name: ");
    fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);
    printf("Enter your age: ");
    scanf("%d", &age);

    // Write the data to the file
    fprintf(file, "Name: %sAge: %d\n", name, age);

    // Close the file
    fclose(file);

    // Confirm that data was written successfully
    printf("File created successfully! Data written to info.txt\n");
